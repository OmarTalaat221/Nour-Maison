The taste is very high. Well decorated place suitable for events. Beats most of other restaurants around with very high quality desserts. I believe this place will be very popular soon.`,

    review: `Best cafe experience to date. It was pretty busy inside but food came out within 20 minutes. Food was superb, tasted fresh and was hot. Really enjoyed the chicken escalope it was light and not greasy and the garlic and cheese topping added the right amount of flavour which was a pleasure to eat. The fries perfectly cooked and seasoned. They really thought out the menu as it has a variety of choices and can see why it becoming everyone’s favourite place to eat at. Can’t wait to come back here. Service was fantastic and ample car parking outside the cafe`,

    review: `We are out of towners (Londoners) and were in Milton Keynes for a bysiness trip. Stumbled upon this on Sunday and managed to get a table for lunch. I'm so grateful for how lucky we were. This place is awesome! The atmosphere is vibrant and the Arabic music playing really got us pumped for a Sunday!

The food and drinks were excellent. The best pistachio and rose latte I've ever had, authenthic flavours rather than the commercial flavours you normally get and are disappointed. My partner ordered arabic coffee and he was served in an authentic Arabic kettle, his response was "every sip transported him back to his homeland."

The food is amazing, every bite is flavourful and balanced. Good value for money.

If you're looking for an authentic, vibrant Arabic experience, this is your place. This place blew me away. I wish they had a Nour in London, we'd be there every day!`,

    review: `A Truly Delightful Experience"
From the moment we stepped into this beautifully decorated brasserie, we were met with the warmest of welcomes from the gracious staff. The service was impeccable, with our food and drinks arriving promptly.
The culinary delights were simply divine! The pancakes ala canadienne and omelette were exquisite. We were particularly appreciative of the halal certification, making our dining experience both enjoyable and worry-free. The beverage selection was equally impressive, from the comforting warmth of the chai lattes and Arabic coffee to the refreshing and invigorating mango and pear juice.
To our absolute delight, the owner generously treated us to some delectable cakes on the house. This unexpected gesture truly added a special touch to our dining experience.
We extend our sincerest congratulations and wish the brasserie all the very best for continued success.
Farhat`,

    review: `I don’t think I’ve EVER left a review before but I was so impressed by the service, food and ambience of this place. From the moment we walked in we were greeted warmly and they even opened the door for us when we left. There were plenty of breakfast options with variety, which is difficult to find in the UK. The music was also beautiful, not too loud. You can see the chefs making the food as it is an “open” kitchen. Presentation of the food on the plate was also immaculate. Drink choices blew me away, with baklava latte etc. Really clean and really friendly staff. I didn’t know that this place opened recently, it seems really well established - I wish them the best. I’m coming back with a friend next week!!`,
